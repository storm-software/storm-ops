# Storm Workspace Tools

A package containing tools for managing a Storm workspace. It includes various
[Nx](https://nx.dev) generators and executors for common development tasks.

## Installing

Using [pnpm](http://pnpm.io):

```bash
pnpm add -D @storm-software/workspace-tools
```

<details>
  <summary>Using npm</summary>

```bash
npm install -D @storm-software/workspace-tools
```

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Using yarn</summary>

```bash
yarn add -D @storm-software/workspace-tools
```

</details>

## Executors

The following executors are available in this package to invoke common tasks for
the workspace's projects:

<!-- START executors -->
<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
<!-- markdownlint-disable -->


## typia

Run the \`typia\` generator to create runtime type validators

### Example 

This executor can be used by executing the following in a command line utility: 

```cmd 
nx run my-project:typia
```

**Please note:** _The typia executor should be included in the desired projects's `project.json` file._ 



## esbuild

Run the \`esbuild\` build process on a selected project

### Example 

This executor can be used by executing the following in a command line utility: 

```cmd 
nx run my-project:esbuild
```

**Please note:** _The esbuild executor should be included in the desired projects's `project.json` file._ 



## unbuild

Run the \`unbuild\` build process on a selected project

### Example 

This executor can be used by executing the following in a command line utility: 

```cmd 
nx run my-project:unbuild
```

**Please note:** _The unbuild executor should be included in the desired projects's `project.json` file._ 



## clean-package

Remove configuration files, fields, and scripts for development before publishing package. The executor will remove these unnecessary files and fields to make the distributable package as light as possible (for scenarios like edge computing, limited memory environments, etc.)

### Example 

This executor can be used by executing the following in a command line utility: 

```cmd 
nx run my-project:clean-package
```

**Please note:** _The clean-package executor should be included in the desired projects's `project.json` file._ 



## size-limit

Run a size-limit performance test on the project

### Example 

This executor can be used by executing the following in a command line utility: 

```cmd 
nx run my-project:size-limit
```

**Please note:** _The size-limit executor should be included in the desired projects's `project.json` file._ 



## npm-publish

Publish a package to the NPM registry

### Example 

This executor can be used by executing the following in a command line utility: 

```cmd 
nx run my-project:npm-publish
```

**Please note:** _The npm-publish executor should be included in the desired projects's `project.json` file._ 



## cargo-publish

Publish a Rust crate to the crates.io registry

### Example 

This executor can be used by executing the following in a command line utility: 

```cmd 
nx run my-project:cargo-publish
```

**Please note:** _The cargo-publish executor should be included in the desired projects's `project.json` file._ 



## cargo-build

Build a Rust project with Cargo Build

### Example 

This executor can be used by executing the following in a command line utility: 

```cmd 
nx run my-project:cargo-build
```

**Please note:** _The cargo-build executor should be included in the desired projects's `project.json` file._ 



## cargo-check

Check a Rust project with Cargo Check

### Example 

This executor can be used by executing the following in a command line utility: 

```cmd 
nx run my-project:cargo-check
```

**Please note:** _The cargo-check executor should be included in the desired projects's `project.json` file._ 



## cargo-format

Format a Rust project with Cargo Fmt

### Example 

This executor can be used by executing the following in a command line utility: 

```cmd 
nx run my-project:cargo-format
```

**Please note:** _The cargo-format executor should be included in the desired projects's `project.json` file._ 



## cargo-clippy

Lint a Rust project with Cargo Clippy

### Example 

This executor can be used by executing the following in a command line utility: 

```cmd 
nx run my-project:cargo-clippy
```

**Please note:** _The cargo-clippy executor should be included in the desired projects's `project.json` file._ 



## cargo-doc

Create docs for a Rust project with Cargo Doc

### Example 

This executor can be used by executing the following in a command line utility: 

```cmd 
nx run my-project:cargo-doc
```

**Please note:** _The cargo-doc executor should be included in the desired projects's `project.json` file._

## Storm Workspaces

Storm workspaces are built using
<a href="https://nx.dev/" target="_blank">Nx</a>, a set of extensible dev tools
for monorepos, which helps you develop like Google, Facebook, and Microsoft.
Building on top of Nx, the Open System provides a set of tools and patterns that
help you scale your monorepo to many teams while keeping the codebase
maintainable.

Storm Software is an open source software development organization and creator
of Acidic, StormStack and StormCloud.

Our mission is to make software development more accessible. Our ideal future is
one where anyone can create software without years of prior development
experience serving as a barrier to entry. We hope to achieve this via LLMs,
Generative AI, and intuitive, high-level data modeling/programming languages.

Join us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/MQ6YVzakM5) to chat with the team,
receive release notifications, ask questions, and get involved.

If this sounds interesting, and you would like to help us in creating the next
generation of development tools, please reach out on our
