# Storm Cloudflare Tools

A package containing tools for managing a Storm workspace. It includes various
[Nx](https://nx.dev) generators and executors for common development tasks.

This library was generated with [Nx](https://nx.dev).

## Installing

Using [pnpm](http://pnpm.io):

```bash
pnpm add -D @storm-software/cloudflare-tools
```

<details>
  <summary>Using npm</summary>

```bash
npm install -D @storm-software/cloudflare-tools
```

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Using yarn</summary>

```bash
yarn add -D @storm-software/cloudflare-tools
```

</details>

## Executors

The following executors are available in this package to invoke common tasks for
the workspace's projects:

<!-- START executors -->
<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
<!-- markdownlint-disable -->


## Cloudflare Worker Publish

Publish a Cloudflare worker using the Wrangler CLI

### Example 

This executor can be used by executing the following in a command line utility: 

```cmd 
nx run my-project:cloudflare-publish
```

**Please note:** _The cloudflare-publish executor should be included in the desired projects's `project.json` file._ 

### Options

The following executor options are available:

| Option    | Type   | Description   | Default   | 
| --------- | ------ | ------------- | --------- | 
| name      | `string`    | Name of the Worker.     |     | 
 | noBundle      | `boolean`    | Skip Wrangler‚Äôs build steps and directly deploy script without modification. Particularly useful when using custom builds.     |     | 
 | env      | `string`    | Perform on a specific environment.     |     | 
 | outdir      | `string`    | Path to directory where Wrangler will write the bundled Worker files.     |     | 
 | compatibilityDate      | `string`    | A date in the form yyyy-mm-dd, which will be used to determine which version of the Workers runtime is used.     |     | 
 | compatibilityFlags      | `string[]`   | Flags to use for compatibility checks.     |     | 
 | latest      | `boolean`    | Use the latest version of the Workers runtime.     | `true`     | 
 | assets      | `string`    | Root folder of static assets to be served. Unlike --site, --assets does not require a Worker script to serve your assets.     |     | 
 | site      | `string`    | Root folder of static assets for Workers Sites.     |     | 
 | siteInclude      | `string[]`   | Array of .gitignore-style patterns that match file or directory names from the sites directory. Only matched items will be uploaded.     |     | 
 | siteExclude      | `string[]`   | Array of .gitignore-style patterns that match file or directory names from the sites directory. Matched items will not be uploaded.     |     | 
 | var      | `string[]`   | Array of key:value pairs to inject as variables into your code. The value will always be passed as a string to your Worker.     |     | 
 | define      | `string[]`   | Array of key:value pairs to replace global identifiers in your code.     |     | 
 | triggers      | `string[]`   | Cron schedules to attach to the deployed Worker. Refer to Cron Trigger Examples.     |     | 
 | routes      | `string[]`   | Routes where this Worker will be deployed.     |     | 
 | tsConfig      | `string`    | Path to a custom tsconfig.json file.     |     | 
 | minify      | `boolean`    | Minify the bundled script before deploying.     |     | 
 | nodeCompat      | `boolean`    | Enable node.js compatibility.     |     | 
 | keepVars      | `boolean`    | It is recommended best practice to treat your Wrangler developer environment as a source of truth for your Worker configuration, and avoid making changes via the Cloudflare dashboard. If you change your environment variables or bindings in the Cloudflare dashboard, Wrangler will override them the next time you deploy. If you want to disable this behavior set keepVars to true.     |     | 




## Cloudflare Worker - Serve executor

Serve a worker locally for development using the Wrangler CLI

### Example 

This executor can be used by executing the following in a command line utility: 

```cmd 
nx run my-project:serve
```

**Please note:** _The serve executor should be included in the desired projects's `project.json` file._ 

### Options

 | env      | `string`    | Perform on a specific environment.     |     | 
 | compatibilityDate      | `string`    | A date in the form yyyy-mm-dd, which will be used to determine which version of the Workers runtime is used.     |     | 
 | compatibilityFlags      | `string[]`   | Flags to use for compatibility checks.     |     |

## Storm Workspaces

Storm workspaces are built using
<a href="https://nx.dev/" target="_blank">Nx</a>, a set of extensible dev tools
for monorepos, which helps you develop like Google, Facebook, and Microsoft.
Building on top of Nx, the Open System provides a set of tools and patterns that
help you scale your monorepo to many teams while keeping the codebase
maintainable.

Storm Software is an open source software development organization and creator
of Acidic, StormStack and StormCloud.

Our mission is to make software development more accessible. Our ideal future is
one where anyone can create software without years of prior development
experience serving as a barrier to entry. We hope to achieve this via LLMs,
Generative AI, and intuitive, high-level data modeling/programming languages.

Join us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/MQ6YVzakM5) to chat with the team,
receive release notifications, ask questions, and get involved.
