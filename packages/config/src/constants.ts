Storm Software is an open source software development organization and creator
of Cyclone UI, Storm Stack and Acidic.

Our mission is to make software development more accessible. Our ideal future is
one where anyone can create software without years of prior development
experience serving as a barrier to entry. We hope to achieve this via LLMs,
Generative AI, and intuitive, high-level data modeling/programming languages.
