description: Query the read-only Nx Cloud Public API for workspace data with `npx nx-cloud api`. Use this skill when a user asks to inspect or retrieve CIPEs, pipelines, run groups, runs, tasks, workflows, agents, task statistics, flaky tasks, cache data, or API endpoint details. Use this skill before any Nx Cloud API call. It covers endpoint discovery, link navigation, pagination, asset downloads, and error recovery. Do not use it for live CI monitoring.

# Nx Cloud API

Answer a defined workspace-data question with `npx nx-cloud api`, the read-only
Nx Cloud Public API command. This is an API access skill, not a report generator
or configuration editor. Run every command from the workspace root so the
command finds `nx.json`.

Run `npx nx-cloud api --help` (or `npx nx-cloud api` alone) once for syntax and
options. This skill covers the workflow around it.

All output is JSON. stdout carries only the response data. stderr carries one
JSON object per line: `{"error": ...}`, `{"output": ...}`, and, with `-i` or
`NX_VERBOSE_LOGGING`, `{"response": ...}` and `{"log": ...}`. The one exception
is an asset download, whose raw bytes go to the `-o` file.

## Non-negotiable rules

- Discover endpoints from the live spec. Use `npx nx-cloud api --list-operations`
  to find a route and `npx nx-cloud api --describe <operationId | path | link>`
  for its parameters, response fields, and error statuses. Both show what an
  operation `returns`: `list` (the wrapped list below), `object` (the response
  body), or `file` (an asset download). Do not use
  remembered routes, fields, filter names, or enum values.
- Start at `cipes` and follow returned `links` values. Do not build child URLs by
  hand or use an internal workflow ID as a route parameter. When you must
  address an entity by ID, use the `{placeholder}` path from `--describe` and
  fill it with `-p name=value`. Never paste an ID into a path: IDs are raw and
  can contain `/` or `:` (task IDs like `@scope/app:build`).
- Start with one filtered page. Ask for a workspace, scope, or time range when
  they are missing. Do not collect history by default.
- Read the operation description from `--describe`. It states server limits that
  the command does not enforce.
- Do not use this skill to poll or monitor live CI.

## Cache boundary

The API returns recorded task and run fields. It does not query the local Nx
target. `cacheEnabled` describes the recorded run. `cacheable` describes the
recorded task. Neither value identifies `targetDefaults`, an inferred target,
or Vite, ESLint, or another tool-native cache.

Do not infer `cache: false` from an absent project property. For cache causes,
target settings, inputs, outputs, or a configuration change, use
`nx-cloud-cache-investigator`. API data alone cannot justify a cache or inputs
pull request.

## Quick workflow

```sh
npx nx-cloud api --describe cipes

# Save one bounded page to a scratch file, then project only what you need.
dir="$(mktemp -d)"
npx nx-cloud api cipes \
  -f createdAfter=2026-08-01T00:00:00Z \
  -f statuses=FAILED -f statuses=CANCELED \
  -o "$dir/cipes.json"
echo "exit $?"
jq '{pageLimitReached, nextCursor, items: [.items[] | {id, status, createdAt, links}]}' "$dir/cipes.json"

# Follow a link from a previous response as-is.
npx nx-cloud api "<link from a previous response>" -o "$dir/next.json"

# Address an entity by ID only through a path parameter.
npx nx-cloud api 'runs/{runId}/tasks' -p runId="$run_id" -o "$dir/tasks.json"
```

Pass a `links.*` value exactly as returned; it may already carry query
parameters, and `-f` adds more. Full URLs are accepted only on the configured
Nx Cloud host. That includes app links such as `https://cloud.nx.app/cipes/<id>`,
which resolve like the bare path `cipes/<id>`.

## Keep API output compact

To preserve context, write every live data response to a file with `-o` (files are created
owner-only) in a scratch directory outside the workspace. Give the file an
extension. A name without one gets `.json`, `.ndjson`, or the download's own
(such as `.tar.gz`), and the command reports the final path on stderr as
`{"output": {"file": "..."}}`. Create the scratch directory with `mktemp -d`,
and read a question-specific `jq` projection. Do not let
a raw collection print into the conversation unless the user asks for it.
Choose projected fields from `--describe`. For one row, select it first, then
project only the needed fields. Delete saved data when the task is done unless
the user asks to keep it.

`--describe` output is usually small. Pipe it through `jq` only when you need
part of a large operation.

## Exit codes and errors

Always check the exit code. Every failure prints one record on stderr, and the
command adds no recovery hints; do not hide stderr with `2>/dev/null`:

```text
{"error":{"type":"http","message":"HTTP 409 Conflict","status":409,"url":"...","body":{"code":"not_terminal","message":"..."}}}
```

`type` is `usage`, `http`, `network`, `response` (an answer the command cannot
use), or `output` (an unwritable `-o` file). For `http`, `body` is the server's
error body, parsed when it is JSON and absent when it is empty. Exit 4 and 5
bodies carry a stable `code` (except 401 and an empty-body 429); branch on
`.error.body.code`, not on the prose `message`.

`--list-operations`, `--describe`, and `--print-api-spec` do not need
credentials, so they succeed even when data requests fail with 401.

Do not alter workspace configuration or credentials without the user's explicit
request.

## Same-session retry

For a 409 `not_terminal` on a known request, arrange at most one same-session
wake after the entity is expected to finish. Preserve the link and filters.
Stop at a terminal response.

## Pagination

Every list response is wrapped, even a single page:
`{source, pagesFetched, fetchedItemCount, pageLimitReached, nextCursor, items}`.
`source` records the origin, endpoint, and original query. Read rows with
`jq '.items[]'`. Non-list responses are returned as-is.

The list is complete only when the exit code is 0 and `nextCursor` is `null`.
`pageLimitReached: true` means `--pages` stopped the run while more results
exist. To continue, rerun the same path and filters with
`--cursor <nextCursor>`, or state that the data is incomplete. The output's
`source.query` records the cursor it started from.

The command fetches one page by default. Raise `--pages` deliberately and keep
it small; prefer narrower filters over more pages. Do not fetch many
`flaky-tasks` or `task-stats` pages without a narrow filter. Leave the page size
alone unless needed: every page costs one unit of the organization's rate
limit, and `--page-size` (which sets `limit`, max 500) only helps when raised.

If a later page fails, the command still prints what it fetched, with
`nextCursor` at the failed page, and exits 4 or 5. Handle the error, then
resume from that cursor.

`--format ndjson` prints only the rows, one per line, with no metadata. Nothing
in its output says whether more pages exist, and it records no resume cursor. It prints each page as it is retrieved which can matter for responsiveness or very large responses.
Use it only when completeness does not matter; otherwise use the default JSON
output.

For multi-range extraction, task or log assets, or a calculation, read
[references/extraction-and-calculation.md](references/extraction-and-calculation.md)
first.

## Interpret responses

Collection responses have top-level `items` and `nextCursor`. Single resources
are returned as-is. Do not infer a field meaning from its name; check
`--describe` and a live record first.

Label cache statements by evidence source:

- **API response field:** a recorded `cacheEnabled`, `cacheable`, cache-status,
  or hash value.
- **Nx target query:** a value from `nx show project ... --json` in a matching
  checkout.
- **Tool-native cache:** `Unknown` until its executor options are inspected.

## Empty task assets

A valid task asset can have zero-byte terminal output and no output files;
`nx:noop` commonly does. Check the matching workspace task before reporting a
log-capture or archive defect.

## Report

State the operations queried, filters, item counts, and whether the data is
complete. State whether a result is recorded API data, a local target query, or
a hypothesis. Never claim that an API-only read proved configuration provenance
or tool-native cache state.
